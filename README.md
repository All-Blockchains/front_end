[TDNS dApp ](https://tdns.github.io)

TDNS is a DApp built for TRON. It allows you to remember your Wallet address very easy on tron wallets 
and Tron explorer that support TDNS.


example : 

address = "TXmVpin5vq5gdZsciyyjdZgKRUju4st1wM"  

in english : 

name = "JusinSun" 

or

name =  "JustinSun.tron"
 
 
in chinese : 

name = "贾斯汀太阳",  

in persian  : 

name = "جاستین"
 

 then you can use the name in wallets or explorers that support it .  

 at this time https://tronwallet.network supports TDNS
